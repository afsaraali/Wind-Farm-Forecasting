Assessing pandemic risk in the US



# Problem Statement

I will be mapping clusters of counties that are prone to pandemics based on spark and spread risk.
Spark risk can be achieved through zoonotic pathogens (pathogens that transmit from animal to human). Spread risk 
is achieved through high population densities within vulnerable populations (those over 60-65, those in close living quarters.)
